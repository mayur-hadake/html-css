  <p>The Rainy Season or more formally addressed as the monsoon season reaches India around the mid of June and stays until late august/early September. This season is primarily categorized by heavy incessant rainfall and humid conditions. Despite the prevalence of humidity, the cool showers bring much-needed respite from the scorching sun.</p>

  <p>As it rains, dry barren ponds and puddles are infused with life again. Rivers, yet again, flow at their full capacity and birds chirp all day long. Rains have, since times immemorial, been the favorite season of the land. It fuels flora and fauna enough to bear the brunt of dry barren summers and harsh freezing winters. Flowers bloom in all their full grandeur and crop roots soak up water during this time of the year.</p>
